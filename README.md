This project is a Unity and C# recreation of the iconic Flappy Bird, reimagined as Effeminare’s Blorb. All assets were created by me, and the focus of the project was to explore core game development fundamentals through a complete, playable experience.

The implementation covers player movement and physics, obstacle spawning, collision handling, scoring logic, and game state management. The project also demonstrates dynamic object instantiation, efficient use of Unity components, and clean C# scripting practices to keep the gameplay responsive and lightweight.

Alongside the build, I’ve included a technical walkthrough that breaks down key systems and design decisions, highlighting how Unity’s tools were leveraged to translate simple mechanics into engaging gameplay. This project reflects both my understanding of game development principles and my ability to execute them end-to-end in Unity.
